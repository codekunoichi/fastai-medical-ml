# fastai-medical-ml

This repository contains hands-on machine learning exercises inspired by the fast.ai course, adapted and applied to real-world problems in ambulatory healthcare.

The goal of this project is not leaderboard performance, but deep understanding. Each notebook focuses on learning the full modeling lifecycle end to end, including problem framing, data exploration, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, error analysis, and clinical or operational caveats.

The work intentionally emphasizes practical healthcare scenarios such as risk prediction, operational efficiency, and decision support, while being mindful of data leakage, bias, and misuse in clinical contexts. Where public or synthetic datasets are used, their limitations are explicitly documented.

This repository serves as a learning gym for building intuition and technical skill in applied machine learning, with a long-term focus on ambulatory healthcare domains such as chronic disease management, patient access, and revenue cycle operations.
